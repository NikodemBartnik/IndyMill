# 3D printed
Yes, 3D printed parts are definitely strong enough for such a CNC machine. I use 3 perimeters and 40% infill to print those parts out of PLA, PETG is also a good choice. Above you can find STL files and STEP files in case you want to modify something.
You can also buy 3D printed parts in my [store](https://indystry.cc/store/).
